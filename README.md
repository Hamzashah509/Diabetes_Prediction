# Diabetes Prediction using SVM

![Diabetes Image](diabetes_image.jpg)

Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction project! In this project, we've developed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict diabetes based on various input features. The goal was to achieve accurate predictions using Python's essential libraries and provide an interactive prediction system.

## Features

- Built an SVM model for diabetes prediction using scikit-learn.
- Achieved 80% accuracy with a small dataset (<80 entries).
- Utilized NumPy and Pandas for data processing.
- Visualized project insights using Seaborn.
- Implemented an interactive prediction system for real-time use.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd diabetes-prediction`
3. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the interactive prediction system: `python predict.py`

## Usage

- Explore the Jupyter Notebook for detailed analysis: `notebooks/analysis.ipynb`
- Visualize insights using Seaborn in `notebooks/visualization.ipynb`
- Check out the trained SVM model in `model/`
- Use the interactive prediction system in `predict.py`
